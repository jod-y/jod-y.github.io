My second day as an intern at the DFS.  


Only 4 of the 6 people could make it today, so our work was more in-depth, allowing us to specialise in our area of interest. Mine mostly consisted of printing 3D design files from Thingiverse.com, learning how to modify the size and orientation of the file in Ultimaker Cura, and using Blender to create 3D objects and designs.  

Overall, quite a productive day~~

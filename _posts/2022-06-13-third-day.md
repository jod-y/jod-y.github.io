My third day as a DFS intern.  

Today was an eventful day! I had more in-depth experiences with 3D design, using Ohshape to create a lotus design based on an online image :) Onshape was an easier software to use than Blender and Shapr3d. I also made a set of slides on how to use the Ender-3 V2 3D printer, which is to be presented tomorrow.

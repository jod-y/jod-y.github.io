30 May 2022  

A bit unexpected! I thought I was there to learn 3D design, but on our first day it was mostly mild tasks such as measuring equipment, peeling the protective layer off the acrylic, etc.  

However, I did get to learn how to operate the laazer cutting machine, as well as how to send files to the 3d printer to print :-)
